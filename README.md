# Slicing Simulator Project

## Overview
This project is part of a networking course and showcases a simulation a network slicing.

The goal of this implementation is to test different ressource reallocation policies and compare the results.

## The simulation
We consider 1 base antenna divided into 2 virtual slices, each with their specified quality of service.

## How to run the code
- Clone the Repository 
- Install the required dependecies with :
  ```
  pip install -r ./requirements.txt
  ```
- Then simply run the __Slicing_simulation.py__ file in __./src__ as such :
    ```
    python3 Sclicing_simulation.py <simulation_time>
    ```
